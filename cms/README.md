####CitySDK Mobility Data Layer CMS

This CMS is the user interface to user-, layer- and data management.
It is still a work in progress, and there's many rough edges. Much of the functionality, however, is usable.

Users are managed through /owners (once you're logged in as the admin user)
See the /install.md document on how to bootstrap the admin user.
