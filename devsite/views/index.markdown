##About the CitySDK Platform / API

The CitySDK API is a distribution platform being developed by [Waag Society](http://waag.org). It enables the linking of (mobility) datasets and city services. Linking a database with planned roadworks to a route planning service for instance. Or enabling citizens to report the nuisance due to roadworks, or perhaps better, let them offer alternative routes to their fellow citizens.

The CitySDK API is part of an open source [European Project](http://citysdk.eu), which means that it offers one interoperable interface for 8 different cities (Amsterdam, Helsinki, Manchester, Lisbon, Istanbul, Lamia, Rome, Barcelona) across the continent. It is a powerful tool to make more and better use of the huge amount of available open data. The CitySDK project focuses on three different domains: Participation (issue reporting), Mobility and Tourism.

###Benefits of CitySDK Platform

CitySDK is a powerful tool because it...

1.	Is a one-stop-shop for developers: with standardised interfaces, developers can build better apps and services for end users and governments.
2.	Offers Pan-European access to datasets, which ensures easy scalability of applications.
3.	Enables the Read/Write City: add a layer and annotate any of the objects and data in the city.
4.	Provides efficient and transparent data exchange between citizens, and from and to the city council.
5.	Enables innovation for businesses, media and citizens.
6.	Manages the constant technological change: adding new datasets and services is made easy.
7.	Is released as [Open Source](http://github.com/waagsociety/citysdk): community supported, and can easily be implemented and amended to local needs.

###Cities & Partners
The mobility API is developed as part of the European [CitySDK Project](http://citysdk.eu). CitySDK is creating a toolkit for the development of digital services within cities. The toolkit is comprised of open and interoperable digital service interfaces as well as processes, guidelines and usability standards. CitySDK enables a more efficient utilisation of the expertise and know-how of developer communities to be applied in city service development.

CitySDK is working in the areas of participation, mobility and tourism and has eight cities across Europe as partners: Helsinki, Barcelona, Amsterdam, Manchester, Lamia, Istanbul, Lisbon and Rome.
